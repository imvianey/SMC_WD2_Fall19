                A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, a row of levers which are pressed
                by the fingers. The most common of these are the piano, organ, and various electronic keyboards,
                including synthesizers and digital pianos. Other keyboard instruments include celestas, which are struck
                idiophones operated by a keyboard, and carillons, which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of
                churches or municipal buildings.
            </p>

                Today, the term keyboard often refers to keyboard-style synthesizers. Under the fingers of a sensitive
                performer, the keyboard may also be used to control dynamics, phrasing, shading, articulation, and other
                elements of expressionâ€”depending on the design and inherent capabilities of the instrument.
            </p>

                Another important use of the word keyboard is in historical musicology, where it means an instrument
                whose identity cannot be firmly established. Particularly in the 18th century, the harpsichord, the
                clavichord, and the early piano were in competition, and the same piece might be played on more than
                one. Hence, in a phrase such as "Mozart excelled as a keyboard player," the word keyboard is typically
                all-inclusive.
