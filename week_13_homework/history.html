                Music is a form of art, which derives from the Greek word meaning "art of the Muses." In ancient Greece,
                the
                Muses were the goddesses who inspired the arts, such as literature, music, and poetry.
            </p>

            <p>
                Music has been performed since the dawn of human time with instruments and through vocal song. While it
                is
                not certain how or when the first musical instrument was invented, most historians point to early flutes
                made from animal bones that are at least 37,000 years old. The oldest known written song dates back
                4,000
                years and was written in ancient cuneiform.

            <p>The Ancient Egyptians played many instruments. They played castanets, drums and bells. They also played
                stringed instruments like the harp, the lyre (a kind of vertical harp) and the lute. They also played
                wind instruments like flutes and trumpets. The Egyptians also played a rattle called a sistrum.</p>


            <p>The Greeks played stringed instruments like the harp and the lyre. They also played a large lyre called a
                Kithara. Its strings were plucked with a plectrum. The Greeks also played wind instruments like the
                syrinx or panpipes, which was made of reeds of different lengths. They also played cymbals.

                <p>The Romans had similar musical instruments, the lyre and harp, the trumpet and flutes. The Romans
                    also played the bagpipes and they made organs.</p>

                <p>In ancient times people played animal horns but in Bronze Age Scandinavia they played metal horns
                    called lurs.</p>
