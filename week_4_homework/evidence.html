                    <p>The mystery behind the sightings of sasquatches (a term used interchangeably with
                        <strong>bigfoot</strong>) took on a new dimension in the 1960's when <em>Dr. Grover Krantz</em>
                        of Washington State University began examining casts and photos of footprints from various parts
                        of Washington. One of the sets of casts showed anatomical features of an injured foot that were
                        either made by a real upright-walking primate, or an artist with an expert understanding of
                        primate foot anatomy.Bigfoot proponents <em>Grover Krantz</em> and <em>Geoffrey H. Bourne</em>
                        believed that Bigfoot could be a relict population of <strong>Gigantopithecus</strong>. All
                        Gigantopithecus fossils were found in Asia, but according to Bourne, many species of animals
                        migrated across the Bering land bridge and he suggested that Gigantopithecus might have done so,
                        as well. Gigantopithecus fossils have not been found in the Americas. The only recovered fossils
                        are of mandibles and teeth, leaving uncertainty about Gigantopithecus's locomotion. Krantz has
                        argued that Gigantopithecus blacki could have been bipedal, based on his extrapolation of the
                        shape of its mandible. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils.
                        An alternative view is that Gigantopithecus was quadrupedal; its enormous mass would have made
                        it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.The trouble with this account is that
                        Gigantopithecus was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the physical
                        evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently
                        adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds.
                        It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in
                        parallel</p>

                        <p><em><a href="https://youtu.be/-x3__akoM5w"> The Patterson-Gimlin film</a></em> is widely
                            regarded as one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the existence of sasquatches.The
                            footage was obtained in a remote mountainous area in northern California in 1967. The two
                            men involved were <em>Roger Patterson</em> and <em>Bob Gimlin</em>. Patterson was a rodeo
                            rider from Yakima, Washington. He was trying to make a documentary about the bigfoot mystery
                            when he went down to northern California with a rental 16mm movie camera after hearing about
                            numerous tracks in the valley around Bluff Creek.The footage has been repeatedly analyzed by
                            scientists over the last 40 years. <strong>It has never been proven to be a hoax</strong>,
                            yet various individuals have "confessed" to being the man in the costume over the years. All
                            of the confessions contradict each other, and are strongly suspected of being hoaxes
                            themselves. No one has ever brought forward the actual costume involved, and no one has ever
                            been able to create a matching costume, though many have tried.

                            The difficulty in creating a matching costume has to do with the <em>limb ratios</em>. The
                            figure in the footage has shorter legs and larger arms, proportionally, than a human.</p>

                        <p>Beginning in the late 1990's and continuing for the next 10 years, fingerprint expert
                            <em>Jimmy Chilcutt</em> in Texas began examining details in track casts obtained in various
                            parts of the country.

                            He noticed <strong>distinct ridges</strong> in some of the casts. Some of the nearly
                            microscopic details showed healed scars where the skin had been previously cut or damaged.Ã‚
                            Some of the casts showed larger longitudinal ridges, which were also thought to be dermal
                            ridges, originally.

                            Other researchers later demonstrated that those larger longitudinal ridges could have been
                            created inadvertently in the process of pouring the liquified plaster into the track
                            impression. The more microscopic details of the healed dermal scars however were not caused
                            that way.</p>
