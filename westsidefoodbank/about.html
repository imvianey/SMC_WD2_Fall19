                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>Westside Food Bank is an independent, non-governmental, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation founded in
                    1981,
                    which provides food to social service agencies on the Westside of Los Angeles County. Our food often
                    enables low-income people to stay in their homes, deterring the problem of homelessness,
                    because it saves them from having to make the agonizing choice between paying for rent or food when
                    they
                    can’t afford both. Receiving our food also enables our 70 member-agencies to devote more of their
                    own
                    resources to other ways of helping clients achieve self respect and economic independence.</p>

                <p> Westside Food Bank’s mission is to distribute as much food as possible to local agencies with food
                    assistance programs and to reduce food waste on the Westside of Los Angeles County. As the food bank
                    warehouse for the Westside since 1981, we annually distribute 4.5 million pounds of food to over 70
                    local social service agencies. We do not distribute food directly to individuals, only to agencies.

            <h1>Where the Food Comes From</h1>
            <p>The Food Bank acquires as much food as possible through donations, but we must still purchase
                approximately half of our food from wholesale merchants at the best volume prices we can obtain.
                Purchasing food allows us to consistently provide our member agencies with the most nutritious food
                possible. The Food Bank also receives produce from a statewide “Farm to Family” distribution program.
                Our Extra Helpings Westside Program, which recovers food that would otherwise be thrown away from
                bakeries, restaurants, caterers and food suppliers, provides about one third of the food we distribute.
                Thanks to the economies of scale and our efficient operation, we can acquire five pounds of food for
                each donated dollar.</p>

                services of our member agencies, our food reaches the most vulnerable members of these communities,
