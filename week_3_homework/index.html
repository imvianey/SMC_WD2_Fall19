                <h2>The truth is out there!</h2>
                <p>In ufology, a close encounter is an event in which a person witnesses an unidentified flying object.
                    This terminology and the system of classification behind it were first suggested in astronomer and
                    UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek's 1972 book The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry. Categories
                    beyond Hynek's original three have been added by others but have not gained universal acceptance,
                    mainly because they lack the scientific rigor that Hynek aimed to bring to ufology.

                    Sightings more than 500 feet (150 m) from the witness are classified as "Daylight Discs," "Nocturnal
                    Lights," or "Radar/Visual Reports." Sightings within about 500 feet are subclassified as various
                    types of "close encounters." Hynek and others argued that a claimed close encounter must occur
                    within about 500 feet to greatly reduce or eliminate the possibility of misidentifying conventional
                    aircraft or other known phenomena.</p>

                <p>According to records released on August 5, 2010, British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill
                    banned the reporting for 50 years of an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass
                    panic. Reports given to Churchill asserted that the incident involved a Royal Air Force (RAF)
                    reconnaissance aircraft returning from a mission in France or Germany toward the end of World War
                    II. It was over or near the English coastline when it was allegedly intercepted by a strange
                    metallic object that matched the aircraft's course and speed for a time before accelerating away and
                    disappearing. The aircraft's crew were reported to have photographed the object, which they said had
                    "hovered noiselessly" near the aircraft, before moving off. According to the documents, details of
                    the coverup emerged when a man wrote to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the
                    incident and described how his grandfather, who had served with the RAF in the war, was present when
                    Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower discussed how to deal with the UFO encounter. The
                    files come from more than 5,000 pages of UFO reports, letters and drawings from members of the
                    public, as well as questions raised in Parliament.</p>
